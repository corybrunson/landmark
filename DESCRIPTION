    person(given = "Jason Cory",
           family = "Brunson",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: Calculate landmark sets for finite metric spaces using the maxmin
    procedure (for fixed-radius balls) or an adaptation of it for rank data
    (for roughly fixed-cardinality nearest neighborhoods).
