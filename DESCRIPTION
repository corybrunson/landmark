Title: procedures to generate landmark sets from finite metric spaces
Version: 0.0.0.9001
Authors@R: 
    c(
    person(given = "Jason Cory",
           family = "Brunson",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "cornelioid@gmail.com"),
    person(given = "Yara",
           family = "Skaf",
           role = c("aut"))
    )
Description: Calculate landmark sets for finite metric spaces using the maxmin
    procedure (for fixed-radius balls) or an adaptation of it for rank data
    (for roughly fixed-cardinality nearest neighborhoods).
